        <h1>The truth about management in Silicon Valley: It doesn’t exist</h1>
        <p>The tech industry is home to some of the world’s greatest innovators, 
            most profitable and valuable companies, and incredible startup success stories. 
            But, these achievements notwithstanding, it’s also a space where there’s a surprising 
            lack of appreciation for skilled management. </p>
        <p>I founded three companies and have worked in the tech industry for 15 years, 
            and I learned a lot of this firsthand through my experiences building Shift. 
            If I could go back to when we launched in 2014, there are a lot of things 
            I’d do very differently in terms of how we set up our culture — understood as 
            the type of behavior that is rewarded and encouraged versus discouraged and penalized — 
            and developed management practices. </p>
        <p>From my observations, lack of proper management leads to the failure of many great startups 
            and ideas. More importantly, it’s contributing to the scarcity of engineering talent and, 
            in turn, the rising people-related costs of building companies. That puts Silicon Valley 
            at a disadvantage.</p>
