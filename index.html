          <h2>
            The truth about management in Silicon Valley: It doesn’t exist
          </h2>
          <p>
            The tech industry is home to some of the world’s greatest
            innovators, most profitable and valuable companies, and incredible
            startup success stories. But, these achievements notwithstanding,
            it’s also a space where there’s a surprising lack of appreciation
            for skilled management.
          </p>
          <p>
            I founded three companies and have worked in the tech industry for
            15 years, and I learned a lot of this firsthand through my
            experiences building Shift. If I could go back to when we launched
            in 2014, there are a lot of things I’d do very differently in terms
            of how we set up our culture — understood as the type of behavior
            that is rewarded and encouraged versus discouraged and penalized —
            and developed management practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            From my observations, lack of proper management leads to the failure
            of many great startups and ideas. More importantly, it’s
            contributing to the scarcity of engineering talent and, in turn, the
            rising people-related costs of building companies. That puts Silicon
            Valley at a disadvantage.
